# Data-visualization
This project analyzes UK road accidents using various data visualization techniques. It aims to uncover the key factors influencing accidents and contribute to enhanced road safety through data-driven insights for informed decision-making and policy formulation.

In the realm of road safety, comprehensive data analysis serves as a cornerstone for understanding and mitigating the impact of accidents. This study delves into an extensive dataset spanning the years 2019 to 2022, derived from the United Kingdom and sourced from Kaggle. Our analysis is twofold, utilizing the powerful tools of Tableau and Python separately. 
The objective is to dissect critical aspects of road accidents in the UK, ranging from the total number of incidents to the categorization of casualties by type and vehicle involved. We investigate the influence of diverse factors, including weather conditions, road surfaces, and road types, on the severity of casualties.
 Furthermore, we endeavor to pinpoint high-risk areas through geospatial analysis, offering valuable insights that can inform targeted road safety interventions. This research holds the potential to not only enhance our understanding of road safety trends but also to contribute to the development of more effective strategies for accident prevention and casualty reduction.

# Analysis
From the years 2019 to 2022, there has been a reduction in the number of accidents. This suggests an improvement in road safety during this period.
During the same time frame (2019-2022), the number of casualties injured has increased. This can be attributed to advancements in road infrastructure. While the likelihood of accidents has decreased, those that do occur tend to result in more severe injuries, primarily due to higher speeds.
Analyzing the data in terms of climatic conditions, it's evident that accidents are more frequent during rainy periods. Rainy weather conditions appear to be a contributing factor to the increased number of accidents.
When considering road surface conditions, a significant proportion of accidents occurred when the road surface was wet. This highlights the correlation between wet road surfaces and accident occurrence.
These points provide a clearer understanding of the trends and factors influencing accidents and casualties during the specified time period in UK.
